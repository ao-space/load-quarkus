# Load Test using Wrk

[wrk] is a pretty handy performance load testing tool that can be used to find the proper qps rate for 
further performance measurement. In this folder, you will get three loading test reports from wrk test results.

- [DatabaseLoadTest.md](DatabaseLoadTest.md): report for a database involved scenario.
- [GreetingLoadTest.md](GreetingLoadTest.md): report for a Hello-World alike scenario.
- [StaticFileLoadTest.md](StaticFileLoadTest.md) report for a static file serving scenario.
